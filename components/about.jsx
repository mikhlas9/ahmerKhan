            I am an award-winning multimedia journalist and filmmaker based in Kashmir. For over a decade, I have
            documented humanitarian crises, conflict zones, and stories of resilience across South Asia—particularly
            focusing on Kashmir, India, Nepal, and Myanmar.

            Beginning my career in 2014 as a freelancer for Al Jazeera, I have reported and produced over 50 films and
            visual stories for international outlets including Vice News, The Guardian, BBC World Service, SCMP, The
            Intercept, and many others. My work has been recognized with prestigious awards including Emmy nominations,
            the Rory Peck Award, Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Award, and the Lovie Award.

            My storytelling is rooted in trauma-informed journalism, with a particular focus on documenting the human
            impact of conflict, displacement, and systemic injustice. I believe powerful visual narratives can challenge
            perspectives and drive change.
